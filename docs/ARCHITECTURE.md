## Real-time Collaboration

### Operational Transformation (OT)

CodeSync uses Operational Transformation to handle concurrent edits:

1. **Operations**: Every edit is represented as an operation
2. **Transformation**: Operations are transformed against concurrent operations
3. **Application**: Transformed operations are applied to maintain consistency

```typescript
interface Operation {
  type: 'insert' | 'delete' | 'retain';
  position: number;
  content?: string;
  length?: number;
  author: string;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### Conflict Resolution Flow

```
User A: "Hello"
User B: "Hello"

User A inserts " World" at position 5
User B inserts "!" at position 5

Without OT: Conflicts and inconsistency
With OT: "Hello World!" (consistent across all clients)
```

## Data Flow

### 1. Document Editing
```
User types → Local state update → Generate operation → Send to server
                    ↓
Server receives → Transform operation → Broadcast to other clients
                    ↓
Other clients → Apply operation → Update editor content
```

### 2. Cursor Tracking
```
Cursor moves → Send position → Server broadcasts → Other clients show cursor
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple server instances
- **Redis Pub/Sub**: Cross-server communication
- **Database Sharding**: Scale document storage

### Performance Optimization
- **Operation Batching**: Combine multiple operations
- **Intelligent Broadcasting**: Only send to relevant clients
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for frequently accessed data

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure user authentication
- **Room Permissions**: Owner, editor, viewer roles
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse

### Data Protection
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **XSS Prevention**: Secure content rendering
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin setup

## Deployment Architecture

### Development
```
Local Development → Docker Compose → Hot Reload
```

### Production
```
GitHub → CI/CD Pipeline → Docker Build → AWS ECS → Load Balancer
```

## Monitoring & Observability

- **Logging**: Structured logging with Winston
- **Metrics**: Custom metrics for collaboration events
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry for error monitoring
- **Performance**: Real-time latency tracking
```
